Mall Customer Segmentation: Unsupervised Learning Project📌 Project OverviewThis project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning to a retail dataset to identify distinct groups of customers. By segmenting customers based on their demographic and behavioral data, businesses can tailor marketing strategies to improve engagement and revenue.📊 Dataset DescriptionThe dataset consists of 200 customer records from a mall, including the following features:CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.Gender: Gender of the customer.Age: Age of the customer.Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonLibraries:Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering)🚀 WorkflowExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized distributions of age, income, and spending scores.Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values (if any) and scaled features for better model performance.Determining Clusters: Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters ($k$).Clustering: Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.📈 Results & InterpretationThe model successfully identified 5 distinct customer segments:High Earners / High Spenders (Target Group): Customers with high income who spend frequently.High Earners / Low Spenders (Sensible): Customers who have high income but are cautious with spending.Average Earners / Average Spenders (Standard): The middle-ground group.Low Earners / High Spenders (Careless): Customers with lower income but high spending habits.Low Earners / Low Spenders (Frugal): Customers who are conservative in both income and spending.📂 Project StructurePlaintext├── Mall_Customers.csv       # The raw dataset

🏁 ConclusionBy understanding these segments, the mall's management can design specific loyalty programs for the "Target Group" and create budget-friendly promotions for the "Frugal" and "Sensible" groups to increase their spending score.
